# FH Snake Game

This game is made with React. It uses Axios to perform Get and Post requests
I have had to comment out the axios post request as the API has reached its limit of requests since I made this app but the code works!

Have a go [here](https://fh-snake-game.netlify.app)

Alternatively run the `npm start` script

This runs the app in the development mode
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser

Be sure to run the `npm i` command before to install the tools I have implemented
